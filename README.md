grunt-jasmine-test
==================

Playing with grunt to play nice with Jasmine and eventually Teamcity


So, the most basic requirements are to have nodejs, grunt, and npm.

For Ubuntu:
I had to symlink /usr/bin/node to /usr/bin/nodejs. (https://github.com/joyent/node/wiki/Installing-Node.js-via-package-manager)


After that, run:

npm install
(sudo might be necessary)

and finally, "grunt".

"grunt" will call the default plugin(s), and is the same thing as "grunt default".
